#Thought Process

Documentation often reflects the **result** of a series of thoughts used while
you code. But the thoughts put in it to bring the result are effectively lost 
or sometimes kept in bugtrackers/mailing lists. How about having the thoughts process
you had, while you code, very near to the code itself? This is what this project
tries to solve. In short, its like **Twitter for your code!**
