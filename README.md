#Thought Process

Documentation often reflects the **result** of a series of thoughts used while
you code. And what happens to all those thoughts which added up to the result?
They are effectively lost. After a certain period of time when someone comes to
you and ask why you coded the way you coded or why you arrived at certain design,
then it will take time for you to gather your thoughts and answer them. Ofcourse
mailing list and bug trackers with comments, provide good picture. But will it
give much more granular details? Doubtful! This is what this project tries to solve.
In short, its like **Twitter for your code!**
